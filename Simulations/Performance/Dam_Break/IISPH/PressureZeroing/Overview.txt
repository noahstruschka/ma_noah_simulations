A higher time step does not need to lead to a better performance, since the number of iterations for the
pressure solver also has a huge impact on the performance.
The number of jacobi iterations is also depending on the relaxation parameter omega which has direct influcence on the
iterational updates of the jacobi scheme.
But these two paramters have also a large influcence of the stability of the simulation, as too high time steps and
omega lead to instability of the simulation.
Therefore a trade-off must be find, between a good time step and a good realxation parameter, to get a simulation which
has a low run time / good performance and which is still stable.
We found out that for the resolution of 320, which leads to a number of fluid particles of 204800, the best time steps have been
between 0.0002 and 0.0003. And as higher the relaxaiton parameter as faster was the simulation.
But a omega of higher an 0.75 leaded to instable simulations.
Therefore the best combination of parameters which we used in our simulations was a time step of ???  and a relaxation parameter of
???.
The maximal density error that we choose has also a huge impact on the simulations since we need less iterations to achieve a sufficient
density value when we decrease the tolerance for the devaiton.
But this has also a big influence on the quality of the simulation as a higher density error leads to a more compressible fluid.
We decided to use a maximal density error of 0.1% for all of our simulations, to achieve a good solution.
